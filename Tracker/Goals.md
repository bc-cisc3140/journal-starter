# Goals

Writing down your goals is the start to planning your dream career. 

Consider asking yourself many questions to hone in on your preferences and goals. 

* What’s your goal?
* What kind of job do you want? (Think in terms of what a day on the job would look like)
* What is the “story of you” that your resume will tell? What are you better than everyone else at?
* How does your story fit with the kind of job you are hoping to get?
* What are the typical qualifications for the career path you're interested in?
* How will you exhibit your potential and proficiency in these qualifications when you apply for jobs?
* What extracurricular activities / workshops / hackathons / etc should you attend?
* How do you expand your network in a way that will open doors when you go on the job market?
* Who will write your recommendations? What do you hope those letters will say?
